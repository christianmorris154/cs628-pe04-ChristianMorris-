# Input:
The application enables users to input information such as the city name, country, and population.
Users submit these details through a designated input form.

# Process: 
The application code is organized into multiple components:

AddCity.js: Handles the input of the city name, country, and population.

CitiesList: Populates and displays a list of cities based on the submitted information. Each city name in the list acts as a clickable link.

CityDetails: Shows detailed information for the city that the user selects from the list.

# Output: 
The application window displays a banner that includes the application's name and navigation links to both the Add City form and the Cities List.
When a user selects a city from the list, the CityDetails component correctly displays the information that was input in the Add City form.
